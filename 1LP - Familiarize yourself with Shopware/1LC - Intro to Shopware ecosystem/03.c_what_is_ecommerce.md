# Intro

## What is ecommerce?

**eCommerce**, short for electronic commerce, involves the buying and selling, goods and services over the internet. This broad term encompasses various activities, such as online retail shopping, digital payments, internet banking, online auctions, electronic ticketing for events, and more. eCommerce leverages technologies like mobile commerce (mCommerce), electronic funds transfer (EFT), supply chain management, internet marketing, online transaction processing, inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems. By facilitating seamless and efficient transactions across the globe, eCommerce has revolutionized traditional commerce practices, making it easier for businesses and consumers to interact and conduct business online.

### Types of eCommerce Models

Your team needs to decide on the type of eCommerce model for your online store. You need to present the different models to help them choose the right one.

- B2B (Business-to-Business) - Transactions between businesses. Examples include manufacturers selling to wholesalers or wholesalers selling to retailers.

Example: Alibaba's platform for businesses to buy large quantities of goods.

- B2C (Business-to-Consumer) - Transactions between businesses and individual consumers. This is the most common form of eCommerce and includes online retail.

Example: Amazon, where consumers can buy products directly from various brands and sellers.

- D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) - Transactions where companies sell their products directly to consumers, bypassing traditional retail channels like wholesalers and retailers. This model allows businesses to have complete control over their branding, customer experience, and pricing.

Example: Warby Parker, an eyewear company that sells glasses directly to consumers through their website and physical stores, eliminating the need for intermediaries and offering a more personalized shopping experience.

Shopware model can be used for any of these purposes.

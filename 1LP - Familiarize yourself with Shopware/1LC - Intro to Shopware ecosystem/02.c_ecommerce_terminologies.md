## eCommerce Terminologies

Entering the eCommerce development world can be overwhelming due to the sheer number of terminologies and concepts you will need to grasp. Here is a list of must-know eCommerce terminologies for you.

## E-commerce business

E-Shopper Inc. is a growing e-commerce business specializing in electronic gadgets and accessories. The company has been facing challenges with managing their increasing number of orders, maintaining consistent product information across platforms, and providing seamless customer experiences. To address these challenges and streamline their operations, E-Shopper Inc. decides to implement a comprehensive ERP system along with the below systems:

- Order Management System (OMS): Software that tracks sales, orders, inventory, and fulfillment.

- Content Management System (CMS) : A software used to create, manage, and modify digital content on a website without needing specialized technical knowledge.

- Product Information Management (PIM): A system used to manage product data and ensure it's consistent across all platforms.

- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): A system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.

- Checkout System : The process where customers finalize their purchases, provide shipping information, and make payments.

- Shopping Cart: A software component that allows customers to select and store products for purchase.

## General Shopware terminologies

- Sales channel refers to a configured pathway through which a business can sell its products or services. It allows businesses to manage multiple selling platforms, such as different storefronts, marketplaces, and social media shops, from a single backend.

Example: A company using Shopware can set up a primary online store for their general customers and a separate storefront for their B2B clients, each with its own pricing, product catalog, and branding, all managed through the same Shopware installation.

- Customer Group refers to a classification that allows businesses to segment their customers into different categories based on specific criteria such as pricing, discounts, access to products, and other custom settings. This segmentation helps in providing tailored shopping experiences, targeted marketing, and personalized pricing.

Example: A business using Shopware might have different customer groups such as "Retail Customers," "Wholesale Customers," and "VIP Customers." Each group can have different price levels, access to special promotions, and exclusive products. For instance, "Wholesale Customers" might receive bulk pricing discounts, while "VIP Customers" might get early access to new products and additional discounts.

- Delivery Times refer to the estimated time frames within which customers can expect their orders to be delivered. These times are displayed on product pages and during the checkout process, helping customers make informed purchasing decisions based on when they need the products.

Example: In Shopware, a product can have a delivery time of "2-3 business days" for domestic shipping and "5-7 business days" for international shipping. This information is shown on the product page and during checkout, so if a customer selects standard shipping for an item with a "2-3 business days" delivery time, they know approximately when to expect their order.

- Number ranges refer to the sequences used to automatically generate unique identifiers for various entities within the system, such as orders, invoices, customers, and products. These number ranges ensure that each identifier is unique and sequential, helping in the organization and tracking of records.

Example In Shopware, you can set up a number range for order IDs starting from "10000". When a new order is placed, it might receive the ID "10001", the next order "10002", and so on. This helps in keeping track of orders in a systematic and easy-to-reference manner. Similarly, you could have a number range for customer IDs starting from "C0001", making each customer’s ID unique and easily identifiable.

- Rule refer to configurable conditions that determine the behavior of various system functionalities. These rules allow businesses to create custom scenarios for pricing, promotions, shipping, taxes, and other operational aspects based on specific criteria.

Example: A rule can be created in Shopware to offer a 10% discount on all orders over $100. The conditions for this rule could be:

Condition: Order total is greater than or equal to $100.
Action: Apply a 10% discount to the total order value.
When a customer’s cart meets this condition, the rule is triggered, and the discount is automatically applied during the checkout process. This allows for flexible and dynamic management of promotions and other business logic.

- Sitemap refers to a structured list of all the pages on a website, designed to help search engines like Google understand the site's structure and index its content more effectively. A sitemap ensures that all pages, including those deep within the site hierarchy, are discoverable by search engines, thereby improving the site’s SEO.

Example: In Shopware, generating a sitemap will include URLs for various pages such as the homepage, category pages, product pages, blog posts, and any other content pages. For instance, a sitemap might contain entries like:

- `https://www.example.com/` (homepage)
- `https://www.example.com/category/electronics` (category page)
- `https://www.example.com/product/laptop` (product page)
- `https://www.example.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-laptop` (blog post)

These URLs are compiled into an XML file that can be submitted to search engines to facilitate better crawling and indexing of the site.

- Cross selling refers to a sales technique where additional or related products are suggested to customers based on their current selections or purchases. This strategy aims to encourage customers to add more items to their cart, increasing the average order value and enhancing the shopping experience.

- Dynamic Product Groups are product groups that are automatically generated groups of products that meet specific criteria defined by the store administrator. These groups update dynamically based on product attributes, categories, or other conditions, ensuring that the product selection remains relevant and up-to-date without manual intervention.

- Import/Export - Automatically import adn export CSV files for products and orders and use them to send data between Shopware and thorrd-party systems such as PIM, ERP orevalution tools.

# Why you should app ?

The introduction of Shopware apps has revolutionized the landscape for merchants and agencies alike. Traditionally, creating extensions tailored to specific shops or small client groups meant developing plugins, standard practice within the Shopware ecosystem. However, with the advent of the app system, new possibilities have emerged beyond plugins.

Shopware's move towards cloud services reflects broader trends in technology adoption, where reliance on self-managed solutions is giving way to the convenience and scalability offered by cloud platforms. The Shopware cloud, built on open-source principles, mirrors the flexibility of its self-managed counterpart, now enhanced by private apps for deeper customization.

Key to this evolution is app scripting, a game-changer that eliminates the need for backend infrastructure in many cases. Using Twig, familiar to developers, app scripting enables logic execution directly within apps, leveraging hooks to modify or add data dynamically. This approach not only simplifies customization but also aligns with cloud benefits like stable APIs and seamless scalability.

The introduction of custom entities with Shopware 6.4.11.0 further expands app capabilities, allowing apps to define and manipulate custom data entities, empowering developers with unprecedented flexibility in storefront and checkout functionalities.

Starting with apps now, whether in cloud or self-managed environments, represents a strategic investment in the future of e-commerce development. Early adopters not only gain proficiency in app scripting and custom entities but also contribute to shaping the evolving Shopware ecosystem. As Shopware continues to refine its app ecosystem, proactive engagement promises mutual benefits: robust system enhancements and competitive advantages for developers and businesses alike.

For those interested in exploring these advancements, diving into the documentation on app scripting, private apps, and custom entities is recommended to unlock the full potential of Shopware's app-driven future.

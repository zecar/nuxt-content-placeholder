# Shopware distribution models

Shopware provides self-hosted, SaaS and PaaS

- On-premise : A self-hosted solution has certain benefits. A merchant can use the system without the need for a disruptive overhaul; the retail organization has the option to control its own hardware, software and customer data, and on-premise is generally perceived as a cheaper option.  

Of course, the need to manage all aspects of infrastructure and software will require a lot of internal know-how, and even finding employees with the right level of technical expertise can be a headache. Traditionally, with self-hosted solutions, challenges arise when it comes to scaling the infrastructure. 

However, it is possible to be self-hosted but actually, host your platform wherever you wish – not just on a localized server. This is thanks to innovations in open-source software. Merchants can buy a license for an open-source platform and use a hosting platform or cloud infrastructure that allows greater adaptability. Additionally, this flexibility in hosting can be leveraged to integrate a digital sales room, offering an enhanced and interactive customer experience without being tied to a single server location.   

For those businesses who do not want to stick with an self-hosted solution, there are other options in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS).

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS): SaaS is a good choice for those organizations who want little involvement in the management of the software and want an ‘out of the box’ solution to set up quickly. The vendor handles all aspects of the software provision from the applications themselves to the way that the data is used and updates are automated.

It’s a safe option – especially for businesses who don’t have the resource to devote to installing software and updates – but it is limited in terms of customization.

- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) : PaaS is a slightly more adaptable option that provides greater flexibility thanks to the hosting and software coming from a single source. Every customer can leverage the benefits of a service model – the top-of-the-range security and scalability, for example – but it also offers many of the benefits of self-hosted by providing more control over data and applications.  

It’s true that PaaS doesn’t come with the automatic updates that you’d receive with SaaS – users will have to manage their own updates and it may take time to be fully confident in operating the software. But that’s an indication of the high level of customization that’s available. A fully managed infrastructure means teams can focus on building ecommerce systems to deliver an all-important excellent customer experience. 


So based on teh available models, TechnoWorld chooses on premise services. Alright, now with these requirements fulfilled, lets see if there are any out-of-the box requiments from the TechnoWorld. Why am I asking this?

If there are out-of-the box customizations required, the Shopware also offers this easily with extensions. Lets know more about this in our next learning unit.
